# Reading Assignment 11 - Code 301

## Why This Matters

Working in databases allows large amounts of data to be stored for later use and building an understanding of how business processes are performing. Getting this understanding will be key in knowing what database structure is best for implementing.

## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL | NoSql |
| --- | --- |
| Called Relational Databases (RDBMS) | alled as non-relational or distributed database |
| Table based databases | Document based, key-value pairs, or wide-column stores |
| Have predefined schema | Have dynamic schema for unstructured data |
| Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |
| Uses structured query language | Queries are focused on collection of documents |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

 SQL databases are best fit for table formatted data storage.

## Give a real world example of a SQL database

For SQL a very popular SQL database product is by Oracle as it is very reliable, secure, easily manageable and productive.

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

NoSQL database fits for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

## Give a real world example of a NoSQL database

Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL is best for hierarchical data storage.

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL databases are vertically scalable.
NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

## What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language (SQL)

## What is a relational database?

A relational database organizes data into rows and columns, which collectively form a table. Data is typically structured across multiple tables, which can be joined together via a primary key or a foreign key.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

Relational databases work with data which is structured across multiple tables, and can be joined together via a primary key or a foreign key. These unique identifiers demonstrate the different relationships which exist between tables.

## What is a ‘schema’?

A database schema defines how data is organized within a relational database. This includes items such as, table names, fields, data types, and the relationships between these entities.

## What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which are unstructured and do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.

## How does it work?

NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema and it gives the developer the flexibility to evolve the data schema without modifying the existing data.

## What is inside of a MongoDB database?

MongoDB stores data in JSON like documents.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why

MongoDB gives the flexibility to evolve the data schema without modifying the existing data.

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

Unlike SQL, NoSQL databases use their own characteristics in the query language used and they're not 100% compatible with the SQL used in relational databases. Support for work query issues in a NoSQL database requires a lot more work in migrating from one NoSQL d/b to another.

## Things I want to know more about

I'm interested to know how to implement MongoDB as I'm definitely excited and want to try it out.
