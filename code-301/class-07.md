## Why This Matters

## Who is Roy Fielding?

Roy Fielding is one of the primary authors of the HTTP specification and the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style of the web.

## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Two reasons, first is being able for the computer to know where the resource is they are trying to reach using a URL as it is nothing more than a proxy to a machine. Second is the resource can be indundated by requests by other machines and can be delayed in responding to a client's request.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

An HTTP request is made by a client, to a named host, which is located on a server. The aim of the request is to access a resource on the server by a URL.

## What does a `GET` do?

When a client gooes to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL the person typed in and back comes a web page.

## What does a `POST` do?

If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

## What does `PUT` do?

If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.

## What does `PATCH` do?

If a system wants do a partial update, it'll use PATCH.
