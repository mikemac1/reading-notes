# Reading Assignment 06 - Code 301

## Why This Matters

I think it is important for coders/developers to understand the multitude of tools available to them with the use of node.js and npm. Getting an understanding of how to implement them is my biggest leap. Hopefully it will be sooner rather than later.

## What is node.js?

Node.js is a program developers can use to execute JavaScript on their computers. Also it gives back-end applications access to a variety of features unavailable in a browser, such as access to the server’s file system, database, and network.

## In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

It sounds like it allows code to be run in a place other than the browser but done locally so it doesn't have to rely on a server.

## What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

A runtime environment is where the program will be executed

## What is npm?

Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available.

## What version of node are you running on your machine?

v18.11.0

## What version of npm are you running on your machine?

8.19.2

## What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

npm install -g jshint

## What is node used for?

Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.

## What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

## In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

Most definitely learning from fellow students. I have been so lucky in getting paired with students who were much better than me at coding and got to learn from them.  EVERY student in this class has something to offer in teaching me something.  Thank you fellow colleagues!!!

## How does pair programming work?

Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer

## Things I want to know more about

Honestly I am excited and nervous about utilizing/learning APIs with Axios. Being able to manipulate data is why I wanted to get into coding and although I'm in the middle of crash and burn I can't help but get excited about seeing what I can do with APIs.
