# Reading Notes

This site holds all notes for Code Fellows' courses. My current course is Code 301: Intermediate Software Development. This will be a best effort to preview the next day's activities, record a summary of what I have read and write down what I have questions on or challenges to understanding. This may include mostly or even all copied & pasted content from readings as I want my efforts to be on coding and not time consuming writing assignments.

## My Personal Experience So Far

I am currently drinking from the coding *Firehose*. I need to be better about trying to be perfect with everything. It is not allowing me to grow with what I truly need to learn, how to code. This collection of notes going forward for 301 & 401 will be a "best effort" and not spend hours upon hours of wasting my time with trying to read articles over and over again to "get" the material and answer questions in my own words.
